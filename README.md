# Calculator-in-Assembly-x86
This repository includes a simple calculator programmed in Assembly language for x86 architecture. It handles basic math operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The code is optimized to work seamlessly with emu8086.

This assembly code presents an Arithmetic Operations Library tailored for emu8086, enabling users to execute basic mathematical computations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Interacting with the library occurs through a straightforward command-line interface, where users select operations from a menu and input corresponding numbers.

Features:

Addition: Sum two numbers and display the result.
Multiplication: Multiply two numbers and present the outcome.
Subtraction: Deduct the second number from the first and show the result.
Division: Divide the first number by the second and showcase the quotient.
